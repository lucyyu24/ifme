if me is a community for mental health experiences that encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies. Trusted allies are the people we interact with on a daily basis, including friends, family members, co-workers, teachers, and mental health workers.

<p>Dealing with mental health is what makes us human. But for a lot of us, it's a struggle to be open about it.</p>

<p>Not everyone is a counsellor or therapist. The people who we interact with everyday shape our emotions and behaviour. Getting them involved in mental health treatment is the key to recovery.</p>

<p>Mental health is such an individual and unique experience. No two brains are alike! Tackling the problem requires ideas from everyone, which is why the project is open-source.</p>
